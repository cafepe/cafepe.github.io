                    <p>FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</p>

                <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong></li>
                <p>FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width
                    and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.
                </p>
                <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong></li>
                <p>Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
                    associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that
                    meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its
                    Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the
                    minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable
                    to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
                </p>

                <li><strong>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</strong></li>
                <br>
                <ol type="a">

                    <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas.
                        Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>

                    <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>

                    <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>

                    <li>n addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
                        dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
